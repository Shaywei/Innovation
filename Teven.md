## Feat Descriptions

#### [Command Undead](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/command-undead-final/)
  
*Using foul powers of necromancy, you can command undead creatures, making them into your servants.*  
  
**Prerequisites:** Channel negative energy class feature.  
  
**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can use one of your uses of channel negative energy to enslave undead within 30 feet. Undead receive a Will save to negate the effect. The DC for this Will save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Charisma modifier. Undead that fail their saves fall under your control, obeying your commands to the best of their ability, as if under the effects of control undead. Intelligent undead receive a new saving throw each day to resist your command. You can control any number of undead, so long as their total Hit Dice do not exceed your cleric level. If you use channel energy in this way, it has no other effect (it does not heal or harm nearby creatures). If an undead creature is under the control of another creature, you must make an opposed Charisma check whenever your orders conflict.


#### [Corpsecrafter](http://dnd.arkalseif.info/feats/libris-mortis-the-book-of-undead--71/corpsecrafter--432/index.html) [GENERAL]
  
*Undead you raise or create are tougher than normal.*  

**Benefit:** Each undead you raise or create with any necromancy spell gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and +2 hit points per Hit Die.

#### [Destruction Retribution](http://marksworld.zeemer.com/files/feats/featlibrary/destructionretribution.html) [GENERAL]

*Undead you raise or create harbor a retributive curse that is unleashed if they are destroyed.*  

**Prerequisite:** Corpsecrafter.  

**Benefit:** Each undead you raise or create with any necromancy spell releases a burst of negative energy upon its destruction, dealing 1d6 points of damage plus an additional 1d6 points per 2 Hit Dice to every creature within a 10-foot spread (Refl ex DC 15 half). This damage comes from negative energy, and it therefore heals undead creatures.

#### [Fell Animate](http://dnd.arkalseif.info/dndtools/feats/libris-mortis-the-book-of-the-dead--71/fell-animate--1101/) [METAMAGIC]
  
*Living foes slain by your spell may rise as zombies.*  

**Benefit:** You can alter a spell that deals damage to foes. Any living creature that could normally be raised as a zombie and that does not possess more than double your Hit Dice, when slain outright by a fell animated spell, rises as a zombie under your control at the beginning of your next action. Even if you kill several creatures with a single fell animated spell, you can’t create more Hit Dice of undead than twice your caster level. The standard rules for controlling undead (see animate dead, page 198 of the Player’s Handbook) apply to newly created undead gained through this metamagic feat. A fell animated spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell’s actual level.

#### [Necromantic Presencse](http://www.realmshelps.net/charbuild/feat/Necromantic_Presence) [GENERAL]

*Undead you control are harder to turn when they are near you.*  

**Benefit:** Whenever undead you control are within 60 feet of you, they gain a +4 bonus to their turn resistance.

#### [Necromantic Might](http://www.realmshelps.net/charbuild/feat/Necromantic_Might) [GENERAL]
  
**Undead you control gain benefits when they are near you.*  

**Prerequisite:** Necromantic Presence.  

**Benefit:** Whenever undead you control are within 60 feet of you, they are physically inspired by your necromantic aura, and gain a +2 enhancement bonus on their attack rolls and saving throws.

## <a name=""></a> [Illumian](http://www.realmshelps.net/charbuild/races/other/illumian.shtml)
* +2 Charisma / +2 Any - Adjustmet to PF
* Humanoid (human): Illumians are humanoid creatures with the human subtype.
* Medium: As Medium creatures, illumians have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
* Illumian base land speed is 30 feet.
 
* **Luminous Sigils (Su)**: The sigils that orbit an illumian’s head glow softly, providing illumination equal to that of a candle. Illumians can make their sigils disappear by concentrating for a moment (a standard action), but they don’t receive the sigils’ benefits and can’t use any special abilities granted by illumian words (see below) while they’re doused. Restoring the sigils to visibility is a free action.
Luminous sigils (including power sigils; see below) are insubstantial and disappear into any matter they touch. An illumian’s sigils remain present and in effect even when the illumian takes another form, unless she would lose her supernatural abilities as a result of the form change. An illumian wizard who casts a polymorph spell on herself retains her sigils, but an illumian who becomes a zombie loses them.
 
* **Glyphic Resonance (Ex):** Illumians are the physical embodiment of a magical language, so they interact strangely with symbol-based spells. This group includes all spells whose names contain the word glyph, rune, sigil, or symbol (such spells in the Player’s Handbook include explosive runes, glyph of warding, greater glyph of warding, sepia snake sigil, and the various symbol spells).
When an illumian encounters such magic, one of two things happens: Either the illumian’s resonance overpowers the spell, or the foreign magic corrupts the mystical language that defines the illumian. Illumians have a –4 racial penalty on saving throws against these effects if their level is less than the caster level of the spell. If an illumian’s level equals or exceeds the spell’s caster level, she is immune to the effect.
 
* Power Sigils (Su): In addition to the array of dimly glowing luminous sigils that orbits her head, a 1st-level illumian has a single brightly glowing power sigil that grants her certain bonuses (see below). A power sigil can be discerned from other sigils surrounding an illumian with a DC 10 Spot check, and identified with a DC 15 Knowledge (arcana) check. On attaining 2nd level in any class, an illumian gains a second different power sigil, and the bonus granted by each power sigil increases to +2. Depending on the combination of power sigils she chooses, an illumian gains one or more extra special abilities (see Illumian Words, below). The benefit of each power sigil is given below, along with the Common translation of each sigil’s llumian name.
 
  * **Hoon (“life”):** +1 bonus on Wisdom checks, Constitution checks, and Wisdom- or Constitution-based skill checks.
 
  * **Naen (“mind”):** +1 bonus on Intelligence checks and Intelligence-based skill checks.
 
* **Illumian Words (Su):** Each combination of two power sigils’ names makes an Illumian word of great power, and thus grants extra abilities to a character who possesses those two power sigils. The benefit of each word of power is described below.
 
  * **Naenhoon:** Twice per day, the illumian can spend one or more turn or rebuke undead attempts as a swift action to add a metamagic effect to a spell she is casting, with no effect on the spell’s casting time or effective level. She must have the metamagic feat whose effect she wants to apply. The illumian must expend a number of turn or rebuke undead attempts equal to the normal level adjustment of the metamagic feat (for example, it costs two turn or rebuke attempts to apply an Empower Spell effect). If she chooses to apply the Heighten Spell effect, it costs her one turn attempt per level that she heightens the spell, up to a maximum of 9th level.

## <a name="Background"></a> Background Story
 
#### Genesis

Teven was born 25 years ago.  
The circumstances of his birth and origin are mostly unknown to him, nor is he particularly interested in them.  

He does not know, for example, that he was born on a completely dark night - a lunar eclipse - something that rarely happens in the known lands.
  
A night when even the ferocious orcs of Pylae did not set out to battle or hunt, but remained hidden indoors.  

A night when people felt inexplicable fear and babies refused to stop crying, a night when the dark forces were working hard to exploit their temporal advantage....  
  
The only thing that Teven knows is that he was born prematurely, a piece of meat of less than 4lbs - barely human (ironically)...  It can be considered a miracle that Teven survived, and his parents, who did not believe it was possible, decided to throw *it* to the trash...

No less improbable, was the fact that not long after being abandoned in garbage, weak and trembling, miserable and pathetic, he was found by a passing beggar who wandered through the same filth in the hope of finding dinner.  

Which he did.

The real miracle, verging divine providence perhaps, is that the beggar, just as he settled in his filthy little alley, lounging in his ragged quilt infested with ticks and fleas, just as he pulled out his dull and rusty knife and a pitiful fork so worn that it had only two tines left, just as he was about to enact an act of famished mercy and end the miserable, brief existence of his meal - the beggar had a heart attack - and fell dead on the spot.  
Amazing.  

But it was not a natural heart attack, of course.  
If you were in the same alley, at that fateful moment, you could see that behind the collapsed beggar a figure stepped out of the shadows.  

Blacker than black, both outward and inward, the figure went to its victim and produced from a pocket two black gems, which it had laid ceremoniously on the eyes of the meat that was the begger.   

The figure begins uttering the complicated and terrible words - words that even without comprehension will cause anyone with a hint of goodness in their heart to feel dirty - words that have been engraved into the muscle memory of the lips that uttered them.
The lips and the words are joined by hands in motion, mystical movements - weaving the symbols of the forces of entropy, weakening the stratum between the worlds.
The ritual reaches its climax with a single word:

"Rise."

"Yes, master. I'm at your service." the familiar words echo in the black figure's head as she lowered her eyes and saw that, as expected, the body opened its eyes and scattered the now-worthless residue of the gems to join the dirt of the alley.  

"Another successful recruitment." the figure thought with satisfaction, and as she sent a mental order to the zombie to follow her, she turned to go.  
  
After a few steps, the figure turns around and says angrily: "Get up, you brainless creature! stop crawling!
**Rise** and **Follow**."
  
Suddenly - a sob.  
A shadow of a sob. Not even that.  
In a rush of adrenalin - the figure quickly scans her surroundings to see if her black deeds been exposed, lips ready to unleash deadly magic that would end the life of the impertinent prankster.  
Nothing. Quiet. A quick spell and the figure's eyes opened to the tangle of invisible energies that always surround us, and another quick scan of the alley revealed to her that there was no living creature larger than a rat (which can be as big as cats in this part of the city).  
The figure turns one last time and is surprised to find an aura of life.  
Faint as a dying candle, small as a slice of bread, resting on the beggar's gruesome blanket.  
A grin, a second's hesitation, a moment of reflection.  
The figure, is suddnely struck by a sudden clear memory of the dream she had that night, a feeling not unlike being stung with needles of ice all over.  
A quick prayer for the Thanatos.  
"Bring.. *that*.. with you." she sent to the fresh zombie, as they started making their way back through the dark night.

#### The Middle years

The first thing I remember is Teacher.  

Of course, there are earlier glimpses. Flashes of images.. whisps of emotions.. trifles.  

I remember Teacher feeding me himself, on all those (often) occasions I was mortally sick and bedridden, literally too weak to life a finger.  
I remember the grim look of determination on Teacher's face, not really looking at me, but through me, as if staring into Death itself as they waged battle for a firmer grasp over me. 
I remember Teacher mumbling: "Not yet."  
  
And the chill, of course. I remember the ever-present chill. Like my very bones were made of ice, yet I still can't grow accustomed, can barely endure the it, often can't control the shivers.  

I remember, vividly, the first lesson Teacher ever taught me.  
The First Lesson. The begining of my training.  

Teacher came into my room, beating the first rays of the sun by a few minutes.  
Me, already awake, my bed made neatly but for a few bloodstains on the pillow from yet another night of coughing bouts, hard at my studies, pouring over a tome full of strange runes, trying to correctly pronounce their complicated names, contemplating their meanings.  
The only light to guide my work is a single, birght sigil revolving around my head, "Hoon" (meaning, ironically, "life") - my sole inheritance and a constant reminder of abandonment.  
Despite my frail physicallity, I excell in my studies and am first in my class, to the admiration of my classmates. Teacher says it's because of the easiness in which language comes to us Illumians.  
  
I remember my first lesson because it was marked by an extraordinary event.  
As he stepped into my room, Teacher presented me with a present. The first I have ever gotten.  
Teacher presented me with a puppy.  
A mutt. A dingy, grey-spotted, shoddy-furred, dirty, panting, red tongued, black-snouted, rubbery-nosed mongrel.  
He was Perfection itself.  
In his usual stern voice Teacher commented: "Congratulations, Boy. We welcomed you into our fold six years ago today. This is your birthday present. It's time for you to learn responsibility. You'll take care of its needs and you'll be punished for its wrongdoings. Your training begins today, after breakfast."  

I decided to make the most of my remaining free time until breakfast and I took Patches outside.  
We ran in the fields outside the order's secret lair, we played, we bonded - an unconditinal love at first sight it was.  
That perfect sunny day, it was almost as if I was healthy. I ran without wheezing too much, without caving to the coughs. I tumbled in the weeds without fits of allergy, without shivering from internal cold. That day, I was happy.  

Night fell and I realized I time escaped me. With a rumbling stomach, I hastly got back and made my way to Teacher, profusly apologizing for missing my classes, swearing to make amends and to never repeat such failure.  
Teacher, for his part, made a dismissing gesture and told me not to worry about it, that I was lucky and that something came up that will delay my training for a few days. That I'm free to spend my time as I see fit.  

For the following three days, Patches and I were inseparatable.  
His eager-to-lick tongue always brought a smile to my cracked lips when he frantically licked at them.  
His cold, rubbery nose alwasy succeeded in driving the chill inside me with its moiset touch.  
And so, it went on for three blissful days. Those were the last days of freedom from training, from chores and duties, from responsibility.  
I'm thankful and fond for those days and I am accepting of the fact that they can never return.  

On the third night, in my bed, on the verge of sleep, I was jerked into wakefullness as Teacher stepped into my room.  
With a quick gesture and a word, I felt my muscles tense as if petrified, my bones locked in place.  
I think Patches knew something was wrong, because he started whining, peering from under my bunk, conflicted between fear and his need to protect me.  
Teacher grabbed Patches by the scruff of its neck, presenting him inches from face.  
Deliberately and slowly unseathing his dagger, he locked his gaze with my tearing, wild open, unblinking eyes.  
"Boy." he started, his voice devoid of all cruelty.  
"This concludes the first and most important lesson of your training." he lectured.  
"This lesson is meant to teach you about the meaningless of your existence. The falsehood of the value of life."  
"Yours and mine and everyone around us, always. Life is weak. Pitiful. Fleeting."  
"You especially, Boy, a broken husk of beaten body, clinging to the flame of life just barely, threatning to go out at any moment."  
"You should make yourself stong and in the face of Death. You should be comfortable with Death and give Death the respect it is Due."  
"When Death eventually comes, whatever form it takes, you should be happy."  
"You should yearn for the moment you earn your peace, look forward for to the shadowy embrace of Death's wings."  
"Death is the only Certainty in an uncertain existence. It comes to all things. It will come to me and to you. It will come to the gods and it will come to the world itself and even time itself. And right now, Boy, it will come to this creature here."  
As Patches struggled and whined even more frantically, as if understanding, Teacher continued:  
"Don't be sad, for this was the dog's purpose all along. It will serve its purpose in Death and thus, this is not a sad event. In time, you will understand."  

With that, and with a precise, quick, merciful movement, I gained the lack of vision I wished for only a moment too late, as a spray of warm blood covered my eyes.  
  
At that moment, the glowing sigil of "life" around my head dimmed and disappeared for the first time. Despite the horror of the moment, there was a part of me that noticed that and thought to itself "Huh. Interesting.".  
Later, I would learn how to control my sigils by an act of will.  

And then, I felt the chill again, like an old friend. Stronger than ever. Always.  
  
....  
...  
..  
.  
  
Five years later, I was able to give release to my fifth dog myself, with my own hands.  
I friendly ruffled my puppy's head before, so that he'll know I am doing him a favor and.. I think he understood.  
Even the chill did not grow any stronger for it.  
I felt no resentment towards Teacher, just admiration of his wisdom. Afterall, he has opened my eyes to the Truth.  

By my 13th birthday, the Order recognized me for being extraordinary.  
Despite being a weakling, supposedly an easy target for their bullying and mockery, I ruled most of them as king.  
Every word I spoke to them, every made out story - they ate, and asked for more.  
Most I could befriend, make loyal. Some I had to destroy make sure that everyone disliked. With the rest, I had the quiet understanding that we should keep away from one another for the most part.  
Even some of the teachers couldn't resist liking me and I could take advanatage of and curry favor with (not Teacher though, of course) - a fact that despite all internal reason made the other kids like me even more.  

So I was given special training. I would represent the Order in various matters, externally.  
I would gain trust of key assets, dig out secrets, gain leverage, corrupt, extort, make likable. Get things Done.  
My custom training seamlessly intertwined the art of manipulation with the Other Art.  

And here I am, now, 22 of age, ready to meet the world head on.  

#### Prolog / A Begining [TBD]

Damn with this pitiful, weak flesh prison.  
Here I am, growing ever stronger in The Art, already able to command real magic, not just simple cantrips, yet my body is dying.  
For two and a half year I've been spying amongst enemies. Accumulating influence, trust and knowledge.  
A master of disguise and an artful manipulator have I become.  
Every now and then, I report back to the order.  
On a rarer occasion I... intervene. Foiling a plot here, disposing of a liability there.  
Now, this body has blew my cover! Instead of completing the spell that would sap my target's strength and leave them helpless, I succumbed to an abominable coughing fit, revealing me in my hidden location!  
I had to flee.. and running did not help.  
I collapsed just as I reached the safehouse.  
The chill stronger than ever, I can feel my life escape my body.  
This is it. The real thing. Thanatos, I am ready to accept your gift. My only regret is not completing the mission.  

To my surprise, I hear Teacher's voice. What is he doing here?  
I'm wavering between conciousness and darkness.  
I hear Teacher say: "It is time.". Too weak to reply.  
But you are right as always, wise Teacher, it is time.  
You taught me well and I'm not scared. I'm proud to have been your student.  
Again I hear the voice: "It's time for The Ritual".  
What.. ritual?  

***

In a dark cave at an unmarked location a husk, dying body of a promising individual is being carried like a sack of potatoes.  
It is being laid at the center of a circle formed of omnious looking symbols carved into the floor.  
At strategic places it is outlined with candles and foul smelling incense and black sand.  
The figure of Teacher kneels above the near-corpse, holding 5 metal stakes adorned with glowing, hissing runes.  
He intones clearly and loudly, words of a language that should not be spoken by mortal beings and around him many other shadowy figures echo his words.  
  
As The Ritual reaches its climax, the dying young man opens his eyes as Teacher slams with full-force one of the stakes into the boy's arm.
The body convulses as the soul, on the verge of escape, is being slammed back into the tortured flesh.  

***

Suddenly fully awake, I can feel the stakes pierce me. Another. Another. And another.  
The sharp pain of the wounds is nothing compared to the pain of the dark magic that starts coursing through my veins, spreading decary and wreaks havoc.  
An unimaginable wave of pain washes over me.  
One final stake and I am crucified.  
My blood is shed, slowly and softly flowing out of the wounds.  
Every second is an eternity of pain. Too painful to scream, too painful to even lose conciousness again.  
This is like feeling pain all the way through and popping at the other side.  
My brief life flashes before me and I remember Patches.  
Anger. Why won't you let me die?! I earned this! It is my reward!  
Don't take this... away from me...  
...  
Why...  

***

An eternity of misery later, the pain loses it's edge, retreating.  
Just like my body. Just like my life.  
I can feel the end. No more pain. No more chill. No more anything.  
I close my eyes and release my last breath.  
  
.....  
....  
...  
..  
.  
  
I open my eyes again.  
The candles extinguished, the room is pitch dark, yet I can see perfectly.  
  
I..  
I don't feel pain..  
I don't feel the chill..  
I don't even feel the urge to cough..  
...  
I don't feel anything..  
..  
And I never will.

## <a name=""></a> [Dread Necromancer](http://dnd.arkalseif.info/classes/dread-necromancer/index.html)
*“Necromancy is not just one school of magic among many. It is an Art, one that requires the Artist’s entire devotion.”*
*—Kazerabet, Angel of the Dark*

A specialist wizard who calls himself a necromancer or a cleric with the Death domain has significant power over undead and the forces of negative energy, but a dread necromancer is their true master.  
A practitioner of vile and forbidden arts, the dread necromancer roots about in graveyards, searching out moldering components for her obscene spells.  
She calls upon restless, tormented spirits of the dead, seeking their arcane secrets.  
She might be a consummate villain, or perhaps a tortured hero whose obsession with death leads her along questionable moral paths.

### Making a Dread Necromancer

## <a name="Creation"></a> Creation Method and Sources

* Teven is a 3.5e character ported to Pathfinder.
* The base class used is Dread Necromancer used as is with two PF adjustments:
  * Skills have been adjusted to the PF system
  * The Turn/Rebuke mechanic which was depracated was translated to PF by giving the class the [Command Undead](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/command-undead-final/) feat + the channel energy ability (usually associated with clerics)
* The race is [Illumian](http://www.realmshelps.net/charbuild/races/other/illumian.shtml) derived from 3.5e's Races of Destiny and adjusted to PF only with the +2 ability modifier to any (based on the fact like humans can have any class as favored classes)
* Various feats and spells were taken from Heores of Horror and Libris Mortis
* Ability scores were assigned using the 25 point buy system:
  * Con - 7 (-4)  → N/A
  * Cha - 18 (17) +2 racial trait → 20
  * Str - 8 (-2)
  * Dex - 16 (10)
  * Int - 12 (2)
  * Wis - 12 (2)

****************************

## <a name="Undead"></a> Type: [Undead](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead)
 
Traits: An undead creature possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).

* No Constitution score. Undead use their Charisma score in place of their Constitution score when calculating hit points, Fortitude saves, and any special ability that relies on Constitution(such as when calculating a breath weapon’s DC).
* [Darkvision](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Darkvision) 60 feet.
* Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects, patterns, and phantasms).
* Immunity to bleed, death effects, disease, paralysis, poison, sleep effects, and stunning.
* Not subject to nonlethal damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Immune to damage to its physical ability scores (Constitution, Dexterity, and Strength), as well as to exhaustion and fatigue effects.
* Cannot heal damage on its own if it has no Intelligence score, although it can be healed. Negative energy (such as an inflict spell) can heal undead creatures. The fast healing special quality works regardless of the creature’s Intelligence score.
* Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless).
* Not at risk of death from massive damage, but is immediately destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.
* Not affected by raise dead and reincarnate spells or abilities. Resurrection and true resurrection can affect undead creatures. These spells turn undead creatures back into the living creatures they were before becoming undead.
* Proficient with its natural weapons, all simple weapons, and any weapons mentioned in its entry.
* Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types. Undead not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with armor. Undead are proficient with shields if they are proficient with any form of armor.
* Undead do not breathe, eat, or sleep.
* Per the spell [magic jar](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spel/magic-jar): “Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.” This is an important sentence when considering any spells or effects which reference “souls.”


## <a name="Necropolitan"></a> [Necropolitan](http://www.realmshelps.net/monsters/templates/necropolitan.shtml)

Necropolitans are humanoids who renounce life and embrace undeath in a special ritual called the Ritual of Crucimigration.

A necropolitan's skin is dry, withered, and powdery. Its eyes are as pale as driven snow, and as lifeless. It continues to dress in the fashion it preferred while living. Necropolitans are considered citizens of the little-known city of Nocturnus, but if their nature is revealed elsewhere, they are feared and hunted like common monsters.

### <a name=""></a> Creating a Necropolitan

“Necropolitan” is an acquired template that can be added to any humanoid or monstrous humanoid (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A necropolitan speaks any languages it knew in life, and it has all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

* **Size and Type**: The creature’s type changes to undead, and it gains the augmented subtype. Do not recalculate base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. Size is unchanged.
* **Hit Dice:** Increase to d12.  // This is no longer relevant in PF since Undead have d8 *but* also get their Charsitma modifier to HP
* **Special Qualities:** A necropolitan retains all the special qualities of the base creature and gains those described below.
* **Resist Control (Ex):** Necropolitans have a +2 profane bonus on their Will saving throws to resist the effect of a control undead spell.
* **Turn Resistance (Ex):** A necropolitan has +2 turn resistance.
* **Unnatural Resilience (Ex):** Necropolitans automatically heal hit point damage and ability damage at the same rate as a living creature. The Heal skill has no effect on necropolitans; however, negative energy (such as an inflict spell) heals them.
* **Abilities:** Same as the base creature, except that as undead creatures, necropolitans have no Constitution score.
* **Advancement:** By character class. Level Adjustment: Same as the base creature. (Becoming a necropolitan involves losing a level—see Ritual of Crucimigration, below—so the advantages of the undead type cancel outwhat would other wise be a larger adjustment.)

### <a name="RitualCrucimigration"></a> Ritual of Crucimigration

Any living humanoid or monstrous humanoid can petition for consideration to undergo the Ritual of Crucimigration, which (if successful) enables the creature to become a necropolitan.   The petition for consideration requires a fee of 3,000 gp and a written plea.

### <a name="Ritual"></a> The Ritual:
The first part of the ritual requires the placement of the petitioner on a standing pole. Cursed nails are used to affix the petitioner, and then the pole is lifted into place. The resultant excruciating pain that shoots like molten metal through the petitioner’s fingers and up the arms is not what finally ends the petitioner’s mortal life, however, since death usually comes from asphyxiation and heart failure. As petitioners feel death’s chill enter their bodies, many have second thoughts, but it is far too late to go back—the cursed nails and chanting of the ritual ensures that the Crucimigration is completed.  
  
The ceremony that lasts for 24 hours—the usual time it takes for the petitioner to perish. During this period, two or three zombie servitors keep up a chant initiated by the ritual leader when the petitioner is first placed into position. Upon hearing the petitioner’s last breath, the ritual leader calls forth the names of evil powers and gods to forge a link with the Negative Energy Plane, and then impales the petitioner. Dying, the petitioner is reborn as a necropolitan, dead but animate.

### <a name=""></a> Game Effect:
Immediately upon opening its undead eyes, a new necropolitan loses a level as if the spell raise dead had been used on it and it was alive instead of animate. (If the subject has no levels to lose, it is simply destroyed.) It then also loses an additional 1,000 XP. If the loss of this much XP forces the necropolitan to lose another level, then it loses another level. No spell, not even restoration, can restore this lost XP. Petitioners may not spend experience points they don’t have—if the level loss and the 1,000 XP cost drains a creature to 0 XP or less, it is destroyed, turned to dust, and can never be raised or revived again using any means. If the ritual is interrupted before it is completed, the petitioner is merely dead.
